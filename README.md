Financial Regulations Dictionary by Mario Tawfelis

What is the Financial Regulations Dictionary?
Financial Regulations Dictionary (FRD) is a platform that aims to help compliance officers to better manage all the financial regulations that matter them in practical and efficient manner. The platform provides a set of tools that allow the user to monitor, capture and search through new regulatory updates.

Monitoring new updates is provided through a News Feed feature which mirrors any newly released updates on a financial regulator's website

Capturing a regulatory update is achieved by using Python scripts that scrapes the regulatory update off of the financial regulator's website. A Python script is uniquely written for a number of supported financial regulators' websites

Searching through your personal dictionary of financial regulations could be based on some criteria such as titles, meta-tags or content. The user is, also, able to download these regulations in a HTML format for offline use

Currently, the supported websites are:

Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) - Warnings

European Central Bank (ECB) - Press Releases

European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) - News
