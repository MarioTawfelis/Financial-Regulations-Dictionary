<h2>How to protect yourself</h2>
<p>We strongly advise you to only deal with financial firms that are authorised by us, and check the <a href="https://register.fca.org.uk/">Financial Services Register</a> to ensure they are. It has information on firms and individuals that are, or have been, regulated by us.</p>
<p>If you want to check a consumer credit firm that may not yet have been authorised by us, please also check the <a href="http://fca-consumer-credit-interim.force.com/CS_RegisterSearchPageNew">Interim Permission Register</a>.</p>
<p>If a firm does not appear on the Register but claims it does, contact our Consumer Helpline on 0800 111 6768.</p>
<p>There are more steps you should take to <a href="/consumers/avoid-scams-unauthorised-firms">avoid scams and unauthorised firms</a>.</p>
<p>You should also be aware that if you give money to an unauthorised firm, you will not be covered by the <a href="http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/" target="_blank">Financial Ombudsman Service</a> or <a href="http://www.fscs.org.uk/" target="_blank">Financial Services Compensation Scheme</a> (FSCS) if things go wrong.</p>
